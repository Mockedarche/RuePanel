RuePanel is a fun project i've worked on which is essentially making my own Divoom panel but better. It has better color reproduction (with caveats), a nice clock presentation, temperature sensoring, IR remote usage instead of an app, and was completely made by me. I sketched, designed, 3D modeled, prototyped, 3D printed, wired, soldered, troubleshooted, and coded EVERYTHING* (couple libraries). I am planning to make it a more generalized and allow for not using certain features, different wiring, and likely different hardware all together. For now I have a lot of features I still want to add including making a 32 by 32 version with some advancements. Any and all questions are appreciated. 

EVERYTHING is in beta and expect changes and functionality to be changed/added.
